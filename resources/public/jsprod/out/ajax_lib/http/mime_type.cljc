; The multipart/form-data type can be used when sending the content of a completed HTML Form from the browser to the server. As a multipart document formal, it consists of different parts, delimited by a boundary (a string starting with a double dash '--'). Each part is an entity by itself, with its own HTTP headers, Content-Disposition, and Content-Type for file uploading fields, and the most common (Content-Length is ignored as the boundary line is used as the delimiter).

(defn multipart-form-data

; The multipart/byteranges MIME type is used in the context of sending partial responses back to the browser. When the 206 Partial Content status code is sent, this MIME type is used to indicate that the document is composed of several parts, one for each of the requested range. Like other multipart types, the Content-Type uses the boundary directive to define the boundary string. Each of the different parts have a Content-Type header with the actual type of the document and a Content-Range with the range they represent.
